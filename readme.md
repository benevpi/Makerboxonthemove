# Makerbox on the move

This project is in the tradition of The Travelling Hackerbox (https://hackaday.io/project/7373-travelling-hacker-box) and The Great Internet Migratory Box Of Electronic Junk (https://tgimboej.org/Main_Page).

Basically, it's a box of bits that electronics enthusiasts might enjoy playing with. When you receive a box, have a look and take a bit or two that you think look entertaining.

Add a piece or two that you don't need that you think other people would be interested in, then post it to the next person on the list. (tbd how to organise the list in a privacy-friendly way).

## Etiquette
* If you receive a box, you must be willing to pay for (at least) national postage to the next person on the list. Obviously things happen and circumstances change (if they do, get in touch), but 
* You must be willing to share your postal address with an internet stranger. We're not going to keep a list of who lives where (infact, you'll never need to tell us your postage address -- you'll co-ordinate delivery directly with the previous person on the list).
* You must have an address that can be reached by national post delivery services. We're not gong to require people to use couriers to reach particular addresses (again, get in contact if you feel this is unfair in your circumstances).
* NO BROKEN STUFF -- This isn't a place to dump junk even if you think someone might like it. It can be components or kits or things that need some work to get them up and running, but it must all be in working order.
* Add instructions or a link to more details for anything you add to the box.
* Keep the size sensible -- we want to keep postage as affordable as possible. We'll try and keep it at a Royal Mail small parcel size: 
* * note to self -- not sure if we should aim for small or medium parcels here. Small might be a bit small. Can get some stuff together and see what we can do
* If you'd like, we'd love to see how the box is doing, or what you've made with it on social media using the hashtag #makerboxonthemove
