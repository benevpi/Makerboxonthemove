# Makerbox on the move

This project is in the great tradition of The Travelling Hackerbox (https://hackaday.io/project/7373-travelling-hacker-box) and The Great Internet Migratory Box Of Electronic Junk (https://tgimboej.org/Main_Page).

Basically, it's a box of bits that electronics enthusiasts might enjoy playing with. When you receive a box, have a look and take a bit or two that you think look entertaining.
Add a piece or two that you don't need that you think other people would be interested in, then post it to the next person on the list. (tbd how to organise the list in a privacy-friendly way).
